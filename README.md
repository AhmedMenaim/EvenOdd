# EvenOdd

We have a number and we need to know if this number is even or odd without using the normal conditionals (if statements or switch) or loops as well.

We won't do that ‚ùå 
```
if (number % 2) == 0 {
print("\(number)" is Even)
} else {
print("\(number)" is Odd)
}
```
Given: 5
Result: 5 is Odd

Given: 6
Result: 6 is Even
